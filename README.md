# March Machine Learning Mania 2025
Another year, another chance to predict the upsets, call the probabilities, and put your bracketology skills to the leaderboard test. In our eleventh annual March Machine Learning Mania competition, Kagglers will once again join the millions of fans who attempt to predict the outcomes of this year's college basketball tournaments. Unlike most fans, you will pick the winners and losers using a combination of rich historical data and computing power, while the ground truth unfolds on television.

You are provided data of historical NCAA games to forecast the outcomes of the Division 1 Men's and Women's basketball tournaments. This competition is the official 2025 edition, with points, medals, prizes, and basketball glory at stake.

We have reverted back to the format from 2023 where you are making predictions about every possible matchup in the tournament, evaluated using the Brier score. See the Evaluation Page for full details.

Prior to the start of the tournaments, the leaderboard of this competition will reflect scores from 2021-2024 only. Kaggle will periodically fill in the outcomes and rescore once the 2025 games begin.

Good luck and happy forecasting! basketball graph
